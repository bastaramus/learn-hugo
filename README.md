# Hi there! 👋

📚 Welcome to my Hugo Learning Diary. In this repository, I will track my learning progress, take notes for future reference, and gather a knowledge base to build my own portals using Hugo.

## 🚀 Learning Journey

**🗓️ January 24, 2024**

1. **Creating a Hugo Site**
   - Initialize a new Hugo site using the command:
     ```bash
     hugo new site learn-hugo
     ```

2. **Version Control Setup**
   - Create a `.gitignore` file.
   - Push the repository to Git.

3. **Getting Started with Hugo**
   - Beginning Steps: To learn the basics, I'm starting with this guide: [Make a Hugo Blog From Scratch](https://zwbetz.com/make-a-hugo-blog-from-scratch/). I'll try to follow it initially to grasp the fundamental concepts.

Stay tuned for updates as I progress through my Hugo learning journey! 🌟 🌈 🦄
